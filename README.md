# Project One: Trivia Game

This project uses our team's skills in DOM manipulation, using APIs with AJAX requests, using APIs with fetch functions, and much more. 

## User Story

As someone with immense useless knowledge, I want to be able to test that knowledge. Then show off my known knowledge in the form of a score. 

If I am a student, maybe I want to test knowledge of a certain category.
